# Nova - Voice Assistant
Nova is an AI-powered voice assistant that uses OpenAI's GPT-3 to generate responses to prompts spoken by the user.

## Getting started
To run the Nova voice assistant, you will need Python 3 installed on your computer, as well as a valid API key for OpenAI's GPT-3 service. You will also need to install the required Python modules.

**To set up the application, follow these steps:**

1. Clone the project repository to your local computer.

2. Install the required Python modules by running pip install -r requirements.txt in the project folder.

3. Obtain and set the OpenAI API key.

## Using Nova
Once you have the Nova voice assistant running, you can use it to generate responses to prompts spoken by the user. The interface consists of a single button that starts the recording process when clicked. Once the user has spoken a prompt, the system generates a response and speaks it back to the user.
