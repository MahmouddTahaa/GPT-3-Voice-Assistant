Nova - Voice Assistant
Nova is an AI-powered voice assistant that uses OpenAI's GPT-3 to generate responses to prompts spoken by the user. The system is designed to work as a web application that runs on a Flask server, and can be accessed through a web browser.

Getting started
To run the Nova voice assistant, you will need Python 3 installed on your computer, as well as a valid API key for OpenAI's GPT-3 service. You will also need to install the required Python modules listed in the requirements.txt file.

To set up the application, follow these steps:

Clone the project repository to your local computer.

Install the required Python modules by running pip install -r requirements.txt in the project folder.

Set the OpenAI API key as an environment variable named OPENAI_API_KEY. For example, you can add the following line to your .bashrc or .bash_profile file:

bash
Copy code
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
Run the Flask server by running python app.py. This should start the server and print a message indicating that it's running.

Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000 to access the Nova voice assistant.

Using Nova
Once you have the Nova voice assistant running, you can use it to generate responses to prompts spoken by the user. The interface consists of a single button that starts the recording process when clicked. Once the user has spoken a prompt, the system generates a response and speaks it back to the user.
